WHU-MHF image fusion dataset is introduced as a benchmark spaceborne multispectral and hyperspectral image fusion dataset, which is generated using paired multispectral and hyperspectral images from ZY-1-02D, including a simulated and a real subset.The study area covers seven scene in Hubei. The real-data experiment consisted of LR hyperspectral images and HR multispectral images with the ground sample distance of 30â€“10 m, respectively. The whole WHU-MHF dataset consists of six pairs of LR hyperspectral and HR multispectral images.
